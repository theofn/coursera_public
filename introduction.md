# Segmentation and clustering using a grid approach and application to Darmstadt area (Germany)

Buying a house or an appartment is of paramount importance to most people. 
It is often the biggest investment in a lifetime and it determines the living standards 
for decades. Thus, potential buyers need to find a location, of which the surrounding area suits their needs optimally.
For example, an ideal location for some people would be close to nature and having
to use often the car and commute would not be an issue. For others, an ideal location would be
close to shops or schools and they might like to minimise the use of car as possible.
So, it would be great if this kind of information was available.

Using the Foursquare data, we want to provide such information using a general grid approach.
The approach is quite general, but we will apply this approach for the Darmstadt area in Germany.
Users of the results can then identify areas which are a close match
to their needs or expectations.
