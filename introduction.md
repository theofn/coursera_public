# Segmentation and clustering of Darmstadt area (Germany)

Buying a house or an appartment is of paramount importance for most people. 
It is often the biggest investment in their life and it determines their living standards 
for decades. Thus, potential buyers need to find the place or neighborhood which better suits their needs.
For example, an ideal neighborhoud for some people would be close to nature and having
to use often the car and commute would not be an issue. For others, an ideal neighborhood would be
close to shops or schools and they might like to minimise the use of car as possible.
So, it would be great if this kind of information was available.

Using the Foursquare data, we want to provide such information for the Darmstadt area in Germany.
Users of this information can then identify areas or neighborhoods which are a close match
to their expectations.
