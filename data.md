# Segmentation and clustering of Darmstadt area - Data

Our approach is to create a grid of segments of the Darmstadt area. 
Then we will use the Foursquare location data to assign to each segment 
the venues which are close to the segment centre and their associated categories.
We will then cluster the segments to using the information of how much of a certain category
is represented in a given segment.
