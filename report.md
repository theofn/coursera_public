# Segmentation and clustering of the Darmstadt area (Germany)

## Background

Buying a house or an appartment to live in is of paramount importance to most people. 
It is often the biggest investment in a lifetime and it determines one's living standards 
for decades. One of the important parameters which affects the property value and 
the quality of living is the location and the nearby surroundings.
In particular, the location determines if schools, public transport, shops, restaurants 
and other facilities or venues are in the surrounding area and at which distance.
For example, an ideal location for some people would be close to nature and having
to use often the car and commute would not be an issue. For others, an ideal location would be
close to shops or schools and they might like to minimise the use of car as possible.
So, it would be helpful to make such information easily available 
so that potential house or appartment buyers can make the right decision regarding
the property location.

## Problem

The aim of this project is to characterize areas on a map using the Foursquare data,
according to their vicinity to various venue categories, such as, childcare, sports,
shops, entairtainment, healthcare, etc. The areas should be characterized by an effective
radius, such that one can reach the venues within a reasonable amount of time, e.g.
no more than 15-20 minutes on foot. To this end, a grid approach will be used and will be
applied in particular for the Darmstadt area in Germany (which is well-known to the
author of this document). 

## Target audience

The target audience is potential buyers for housing reasons. 
Users of the results of this project will be able to identify areas which are a close match
to their needs or expectations.
